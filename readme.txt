Hey Georgina,

So i've created a rough project where you can drop in your code. Feel free to hack/edit/change anything as you see fit.

Theres an assets/styles folder which will house all your styles.

Ive added fontawesome too if you need to add icons, again, dont worry too much about this, if you look at line 19 in index.html you'll see how to include them and heres a link to get familiar with them. https://fontawesome.com/

Ive also added a jQuery CDN so jquery will be loaded by default (if you need it)

But again, you're not tied to any of these.

Dont be under pressure to get ALL modules done, theres quiet a bit there. And if you're stuck for images, you can just use placeholders. Such as https://placeimg.com/ etc.

So a few pointers,

  Try to use comments,
  Keep the code clean and concise
  Nice formatting for legible code.
  Structured consistent code

Just remember, this ISNT A TEST, it will just give us a rough estimate of where you're at.

Any questions feel free to reach out -> darragh@deveire.com
